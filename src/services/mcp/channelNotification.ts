/**
 * Channel notifications — lets an MCP server push user messages into the
 * conversation. A "channel" (Discord, Slack, SMS, etc.) is just an MCP server
 * that:
 *   - exposes tools for outbound messages (e.g. `send_message`) — standard MCP
 *   - sends `notifications/claude/channel` notifications for inbound — this file
 *
 * The notification handler wraps the content in a <channel> tag and
 * enqueues it. SleepTool polls hasCommandsInQueue() and wakes within 1s.
 * The model sees where the message came from and decides which tool to reply
 * with (the channel's MCP tool, SendUserMessage, or both).
 *
 * feature('KAIROS') || feature('KAIROS_CHANNELS'). Runtime gate tengu_harbor.
 * Explicitly configured MCP servers work with any supported model provider.
 * Teams/Enterprise orgs must explicitly opt in via channelsEnabled: true in
 * managed settings.
